## [Lever](https://www.lever.co)
*Intuitive ATS + CRM combo that emphasizes talent relationship management for proactive recruiting.*

![Lever Screenshot](image/lever.webp)


Lever is loved by many high-growth companies for its **modern design and CRM approach** to recruiting. In Lever, candidates aren’t just applications stuck in a pipeline; they’re treated like connections you can **nurture over time**. This dual ATS-CRM nature means you can keep a talent database, engage past prospects, and source new ones all in one place. For example, if you find a great candidate but not for an open role, Lever makes it easy to tag them, add them to a pipeline for future roles, and stay in touch – ensuring you have warm leads when a position opens.

The user interface is clean and collaborative. Hiring managers and recruiters can easily share feedback via @mentions, and everything updates in real-time across the team. Lever’s Chrome extension is a favorite for sourcers, allowing quick import of candidate profiles from LinkedIn or other sites straight into the ATS. And when it comes to offers and hiring, Lever streamlines that too with built-in offer management and approval workflows.

**Analytics** in Lever are also pretty robust for a mid-market tool – you can track conversion rates at each stage, diversity metrics, and recruiting productivity. They even have visual dashboards for executives to monitor hiring progress. Now part of the Employ Inc. family (alongside Jobvite and JazzHR), Lever continues to innovate but remains focused on delivering a **user-friendly, collaborative recruiting experience**. If you want to actively build relationships with candidates (not just process them), Lever’s your platform.

## [JazzHR](https://www.jazzhr.com)
*Straightforward recruiting software tailor-made for small businesses, offering robust features without breaking the bank.*

![JazzHR Screenshot](image/jazzhr.webp)


JazzHR has long been a champion for **small and mid-sized businesses** in the ATS market. Its claim to fame is providing all the essential hiring tools in an affordable, easy-to-use package – like giving smaller teams their own “HR jazz band” to conduct a smooth hiring symphony. 🎷 (Yes, JazzHR’s musical theme even makes HR feel a bit more fun!)

With JazzHR, you get the core features: job postings to multiple boards, a centralized candidate database, resume parsing, custom questionnaires for applicants, and collaborative interview feedback. The interface is intuitive; you don’t need an HR certification to figure out how to create a job opening or move candidates through stages. One of its popular features is **workflow automation** – you can set rules like “if candidate is moved to Interview stage, automatically send them a calendar invite and an assessment link.” This saves tons of manual follow-up.

The system also shines in offering customization for things like **templates** (emails, interview guides) and **reports** (e.g., EEO reports for compliance). Despite its rich features, JazzHR keeps pricing reasonable with tiered plans, and notably it’s **flat pricing** (unlimited users on most plans), which small companies appreciate so everyone can collaborate. In summary, JazzHR hits the sweet spot for smaller organizations: powerful enough to significantly improve your hiring process, but simple and budget-friendly enough to get quick buy-in from your team.

## [iCIMS](https://www.icims.com)
*Highly scalable talent acquisition platform, known for its enterprise ATS capabilities and extensive integration options.*

![iCIMS Screenshot](image/icims.webp)


If you’re part of a large organization (or planning to become one), you’ve likely heard of iCIMS. It’s a heavyweight in the recruiting software arena – the kind of platform that’s built to handle **massive hiring volumes and complex workflows**. iCIMS offers a comprehensive suite that goes beyond ATS into areas like recruitment marketing (candidate relationship management), onboarding, and even text recruiting. Essentially, it’s a **talent cloud**.

What sets iCIMS apart is its robustness and configurability. Need to manage multiple brands or divisions with separate hiring processes? iCIMS can do that. Require integrations with Oracle, SAP, Workday, or a custom HR system? iCIMS has an expansive integration marketplace and API support. It’s designed to slot into enterprise IT ecosystems seamlessly, and they provide a lot of support to get it right. The reporting in iCIMS is also top-notch – from high-level executive summaries to granular operational reports – allowing large organizations to monitor and optimize every aspect of their talent pipeline.

Candidates don’t get left out either: iCIMS helps companies create branded career portals and has features like text alerts to keep applicants engaged. That said, iCIMS is **best suited for larger teams**; the system’s depth comes with complexity that smaller businesses may find overwhelming (and cost-prohibitive). But for enterprises that need reliability at scale and a platform that can be finely tuned to their recruiting strategy, iCIMS is a proven solution trusted by thousands of big-name employers.

## [Jobvite](https://www.jobvite.com)
*End-to-end talent acquisition suite with a strong ATS core, famed for recruitment marketing and employee referral features.*

![Jobvite Screenshot](image/jobvite.webp)


Jobvite has been a pioneer in the recruiting software world, especially known for pushing the envelope on **recruitment marketing** – i.e., the practice of engaging candidates before they even apply. While Jobvite offers a powerful ATS to manage requisitions and applicants, it goes further by providing tools to nurture talent communities, run email/text campaigns to candidates, and even leverage your employees’ networks through a robust **employee referral module**. The idea is to build pipelines of interested talent so hiring becomes faster and easier.

In daily use, Jobvite’s ATS is feature-rich: easy job postings, configurable workflows, interview scheduling (with Outlook/Gmail sync), and collaborative evaluations. One cool aspect: their analytics platform (Jobvite Analytics) can crunch data across the entire hiring funnel and across all modules (ATS, CRM, referrals) to give you insights like which source produces the highest-quality hires or where bottlenecks occur. They’ve also integrated onboarding in recent years, making it a full hire-to-hire (re-hire) cycle platform.

Jobvite caters mostly to mid and enterprise markets, and it’s part of the Employ Inc. group now. This synergy means if you use Jobvite, you’re in an ecosystem that includes JazzHR and Lever (sometimes enabling easier migrations or multi-product use for different divisions). If your organization wants a **holistic approach to talent acquisition** – attracting candidates, engaging them, hiring efficiently, and analyzing everything – Jobvite provides the tools to do all of that under one roof.

## [ClearCompany](https://www.clearcompany.com)
*Unified talent management system with an excellent ATS, ideal for aligning hiring with performance and engagement.*

![ClearCompany Screenshot](image/clearcompany.webp)


ClearCompany may not have the same name recognition as some giants, but it’s a powerful platform especially praised by those who value **integration between hiring and talent management**. ClearCompany’s ATS is frequently lauded for being easy to use yet highly configurable – you can tailor pipelines, interview stages, and communication templates to fit your organization’s style. It covers the standard ATS features (job distribution, candidate scoring, interview scheduling) with finesse.

What makes ClearCompany “clear” (as in standout) is its alignment of hiring with broader talent goals. It’s not just about filling a vacancy; it’s about ensuring you hire people who will thrive and then continuing to support them. The system seamlessly connects ATS with onboarding, performance management, and even goal tracking. For example, a hiring manager can see the interview feedback alongside the job description’s key objectives, ensuring candidates are evaluated with end goals in mind. Later on, once hired, those goals can transition into the employee’s performance plan in ClearCompany’s system. It’s a continuum.

This holistic approach is great for companies that want an all-in-one platform. Another plus: ClearCompany provides **open APIs and integration partners**, so if you have a payroll system or other HR tech, chances are it can connect. The platform is cloud-based and they’ve been enhancing the UI consistently, making it more modern and mobile-responsive. **All told,** ClearCompany is a gem for mid-sized organizations that want to unify recruiting with the bigger talent picture – getting the right people and keeping them on track long-term.

If you’re a fan of intuitive software (who isn’t?), Recruitee’s slick drag-and-drop pipelines and clear dashboards will draw you in. The system is highly collaborative: hiring managers can leave star ratings and comments, recruiters can tag colleagues, and everyone stays on the same page with activity feeds. It feels a bit like using a well-designed project management tool, but for hiring.

One area where Recruitee shines is catering to an international audience. It supports multiple languages and offers features like localized career sites – handy if you’re hiring across different regions.

Little touches, like a mobile-friendly job site and easy calendar scheduling, improve the candidate experience as well.

Recruitee isn’t just looks though. Under the hood, you get advanced features like boolean search in your talent pool, custom hiring roles/permissions, and analytics that track your KPIs (e.g., time-to-fill, cost-of-hire). It also integrates with a bunch of apps (assessment tools, HRIS, etc.), often via Zapier or native integrations. Pricing is typically based on the number of active jobs, which scales well for growing companies. For organizations that want a **modern, collaborative hiring tool** without a steep learning curve, Recruitee is a top-of-the-line choice.

## [Bullhorn](https://www.bullhorn.com)
*Premier recruiting CRM & ATS for staffing agencies, offering end-to-end workflow management from sourcing to placements.*

![Bullhorn Screenshot](image/bullhorn.webp)


Bullhorn is practically synonymous with **staffing and recruiting agencies** – it’s been the industry standard in that space for years. Unlike some ATS platforms that focus purely on internal hiring, Bullhorn is built to handle the dual-sided nature of agency work: managing candidates *and* client relationships. It’s both a powerful ATS for tracking applicants and a robust CRM for tracking client jobs, contacts, and sales activities. This means a recruiting firm can manage the entire placement process in one system, from getting a job order from a client to sourcing candidates, matching them, and tracking the hire and billing.

Key features of Bullhorn include excellent **resume parsing** (to quickly build candidate profiles), advanced search and filtering (to find that needle-in-haystack candidate in your database), and automated workflows (like triggering emails or tasks when a placement is made). It also has a **VMS integration** tool – essentially it can integrate with Vendor Management Systems to pull in requisitions directly from clients (great for agencies working with large enterprise contracts).

Bullhorn’s ecosystem is noteworthy too: they have a marketplace of add-on apps and integrations (for things like background checks, interviewing tools, etc.), and an open API for customization. They also offer mobile apps for recruiters on the go. While Bullhorn can be used by in-house corporate HR, it’s truly optimized for agencies and recruiting professionals who need to juggle many reqs and clients concurrently. **Bottom line:** If you’re running a staffing or recruiting agency, Bullhorn speaks your language and addresses pain points specific to your world, at scale.

For companies (or agencies) that need to fill roles *yesterday*, Ceipal helps speed things up.

It can automatically pick up jobs from VMS portals and streamline candidate submissions back, essentially automating a lot of the busy-work agencies face. Additionally, Ceipal has some HRIS capabilities: timesheet management, expense tracking, etc., particularly useful if you place contractors and need to manage their ongoing details after hiring.

This platform prides itself on being highly **integrated** – LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster, etc., all can connect for one-click sourcing. It’s also known for strong analytics, giving insights on recruiter performance, job fulfillment rates, and so forth. Ceipal’s pricing is relatively competitive, often based on number of recruiters using the system. **In summary,** Ceipal is a robust choice for organizations that have heavy recruiting loads, especially in contract staffing, and want to leverage AI and automation to supercharge their process.

Recruiters enjoy the drag-and-drop pipeline, resume parsing, and the easy way you can tag and search through profiles. Collaboration is supported through team notes and @mentions. Also worth noting: Manatal includes some diversity recruiting tools, helping mask candidates’ info to reduce bias during screening if needed. They offer a **14-day free trial** and straightforward pricing (starting around ~$15/user per month), which is very attractive for what you get.

Particularly popular with recruiting agencies and headhunters, Loxo provides an ATS for applicant tracking, a CRM for client and candidate relationship management, and an integrated AI sourcing tool that’s like having a mini LinkedIn Recruiter and contact finder built right in. In fact, Loxo claims access to a vast global directory of candidates (hundreds of millions of profiles) that recruiters can search and then reach out to directly via email, call, or even text – all from within the platform. It essentially collapses the steps of needing separate sourcing subscriptions and ATS into one flow.

The ATS part of Loxo handles job tracking, pipeline stages, interview scheduling, etc., while the CRM lets agencies track sales funnels, client interactions, and job orders. Loxo also has **automation capabilities**: for instance, you can set up sequences to email or text candidates at certain stages, or reminders to follow up with contacts. This can dramatically increase a recruiter’s bandwidth. And because the system is cloud-based and mobile-friendly, recruiters on the move (or working remotely) can keep the engines running from anywhere.

Loxo’s interface is fairly straightforward given how much it offers, but new users might take a bit to explore all the features. It’s offered on a subscription basis, often customized to whether you want their full sourcing data access or just the ATS/CRM part. If you’re an agency recruiter or part of a talent acquisition team that needs a **high-octane recruiting machine** (sourcing + ATS + CRM in one), Loxo is definitely worth a look.

One of Recruit CRM’s charming points is its **focus on simplicity**. The interface is straightforward and doesn’t require a week of training to grasp. Recruiters often highlight that they can tailor fields and pipelines easily, so the system adapts to their workflow (rather than forcing them to adapt). It also supports things like email integration (sending/receiving emails within the app, logged to candidate records) which keeps communications in one place.

Another highlight is Recruit CRM’s reputation for **customer support**. Users frequently mention quick, helpful responses and a willingness to consider feature suggestions – likely because the company is a bit smaller and very customer-focused. They also have an affiliate program and have been actively improving the product year over year. For pricing, it’s pretty affordable (flat pricing options for small teams).

For example, you can set up automated email sequences to candidates: if a candidate is added to a particular job pipeline, the system can send a series of personalized emails over time (great for engaging passive candidates or nurturing a talent pool). It also automates reminders and follow-ups, which is a lifesaver when you’re juggling dozens of candidates and clients simultaneously.

The ATS component covers the usual – job posting, pipeline management, resume parsing, interview scheduling – in a clean interface. A nice twist is that Recruiterflow integrates a *Kanban-style* view as well as list views, so you can visualize your hiring stages whichever way you like. On the CRM side, you track your clients and their job orders, and you can even generate client-specific reports with a click (showing how many candidates submitted, interviews scheduled, etc., for each client’s roles). This transparency is great for agency-client relationships.

Recruiterflow also offers a Chrome extension to easily import candidate data from LinkedIn, GitHub, or other websites – a handy sourcing tool. Collaboration-wise, if you have a team of recruiters, you can assign roles, split jobs, and share candidate notes. The product is cloud-based and the team behind it is known to roll out improvements regularly (often influenced by user feedback). For independent recruiters or agencies wanting to **boost productivity through smart automation** and keep both candidate and client management under control, Recruiterflow delivers a well-thought-out platform.

Recruiteze may not have the flashiest name, but it focuses on delivering what entry-level ATS users need most: an easy way to track job applicants and organize the hiring process. It’s a boon for those moving from email-and-spreadsheet hiring into a dedicated system for the first time. Because Recruiteze is **web-based and straightforward**, you can get your jobs and candidates set up in no time.

The emphasis is on clarity – at any point you should know how many candidates are in which stage for each job.

Another handy tool is their resume formatting service (if you opt for it): essentially, it can standardize resume layouts if you’re sending candidate resumes to clients, which is a unique add-on for agencies or consultancies that present candidates externally.

**FAQ: Common Questions about Recruiting Software**

**Q1: How do I choose the right recruiting software for my company’s needs?**
**A1:** Start by considering your hiring volume and team size. For a small business with occasional hiring, a lightweight tool (or one with a free tier) might suffice. Larger teams or those hiring constantly may need more robust features like automation, analytics, and integrations with HR systems. List your “must-have” features (e.g., job board posting, interview scheduling, team collaboration) and evaluate platforms against those. Most importantly, take advantage of free trials or demos – experiencing the interface firsthand will tell you if it’s a good fit.

**Q2: Can these ATS platforms integrate with our existing HR or communication tools?**
**A2:** In most cases, yes. Many modern ATS platforms offer integrations with common tools such as HRIS systems (for syncing new hire data), email/calendar apps (Gmail, Outlook for scheduling), and communication tools (Slack, MS Teams for notifications). Some have open APIs, meaning if an out-of-the-box integration isn’t available, your tech team can connect the systems. Before deciding, check the integration options of each platform to ensure it connects with your crucial apps (or at least allows data export/import as a workaround).

**Q3: How do recruiting software solutions improve the quality of hire, not just speed?**
**A3:** Good recruiting software helps improve quality of hire by providing features like structured interviews and scorecards (so candidates are evaluated consistently on relevant criteria), centralized feedback (hiring team members can see each other’s notes and make more informed collective decisions), and analytics to track which sources or processes yield the best long-term employees. Some tools include AI matching to surface candidates who are a strong fit, which can increase the likelihood of a successful hire. Ultimately, the software organizes and presents information so you can make data-informed hiring decisions, rather than relying on gut feeling alone.
